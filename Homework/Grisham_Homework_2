1: Basic Building Blocks
-Showed the math operators within RStudio and how previous commands are
saved.

2: Workspace and Files
-Demonstrated how to create and navigate through a directory and files within.

3: Sequences of numbers
-Introduced how to use ':', length(), seq(), seq_along(), and rep(), for 
sequencing numbers

4: Vectors
-Learnt how to create and modify vectors of numbers and characters, as well as
using logical operators on vectors

5: Missing Values
-Showed the use of NA and NaN in vectors, and how to simply parse through vectors
with both numbers and NA/NaN values

6: sSubsetting vectors
-How to create, and index vectors, and also combine two vectors and test
the similarity of vectors

7: Matrices and data frames
-Turned vectors into matrixes and then into a data frame, slightly confusing with
how RStudio makes assumptions for classifications, and how simple it is to modify
the matrix.

8: Logic
-Pretty straight forward for using logical functions such as TRUE, FALSE, &, OR,
XOR, etc...

9: Functions
-In this lesson I learnt how to create functions, how to nest them in other functions, 
and how to modify functions.

12: Looking at data
-This lesson showed the basics of how to parse through a large data set and 
efficiently get important information from it.
